### Geography

I live in the city of San Francisco, in the state of California, in the United States of America.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Me Talk Pretty One Day* by David Sedaris
- *The God of Small Things* by Arundhati Roy
- *Blindness* by Jose Saramago

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Sukiyabshi Jiro in Tokyo.
2. Osteria Francescana in Modena.
3. Californios in San Francisco.
